<p>The communications we publish from Bishops who receive aid from
the annual collections for our Negro and Indian missions, show very
simply and forcibly the importance and needs of this work. Passages
from the letters of Archbishop Janssens, of New Orleans, of Bishop
O’Sullivan, of Mobile and of Rev. Father Molony of the diocese of San
Antonio, may help to answer a question as to the ultimate outcome of
what is being done, that doubtless arises in many minds.</p>

<p class="tb">The Archbishop says:</p>

<p>“In another portion of the diocese, at Grossetete Bayou, there is a
somewhat similar settlement of negroes, who before the war were sold
in Maryland, to Louisiana Protestant planters. The history of their
trials for religion, their constancy to the faith, would embellish a page in
the history of the Martyrs of the Church. Much is said of the inconsistency
of the negro, but my experience convinces me, that when the negro
has been brought up in the knowledge and practice of religion, he is as
constant as any white Catholic under the circumstances. Bad training
and ignorance degenerate their mind and heart, as it does with the white
population. We are trying to raise means to build a church for that
settlement. I regret very much that the Commission has been obliged
to diminish the allocation. Our work is increasing and the funds diminishing.
May the Lord provide some other means.”</p>

<p class="tb">Bishop O’Sullivan writes:</p>

<p>“We receive very few adult converts from among the colored people.
However, the proportion of colored converts is equal to the number of
white converts. Hence, there is no reason why we should look upon
the conversion of the colored people as hopeless; on the contrary the
outlook is encouraging. If we plant the good seed, our successors will
reap a rich harvest. The Catholics in the South are so few, that it is
impossible for them to supply missionaries and means to carry on the
work. Help must come from outside. May God bless all who help
this mission.”</p>

<p class="tb">Rev. R. J. Molony writes: “Our work in this diocese is assuming a
brighter look. God has blessed it this year beyond our most sanguine
expectations. Our experience of the past did not inspire much hope.
Since the foundation of the mission in 1888, our colored people have
stood aloof and looked on our labors with cold indifference. They
seemed to assume an attitude of distrust. Within the present year we
have noticed a change in their behavior towards the mission and the
Catholic church. Now they approach with more confidence. The better
class, the religiously disposed, receive religious instruction. They begin
to appreciate the intellectual and moral improvement of the children
who attend our schools.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Colored_and_Indian_Missions">The Colored and Indian Missions.</h2>

</div>

<p>The following is taken from a Pastoral Letter issued last year by Rt.
Rev. Bishop McCloskey of Louisville. It sets forth strongly and
earnestly the claims of the Negro and Indian mission work to our
sympathy and generous aid.</p>

<p>“If thousands of these wretched beings of whom we speak, are still
as ignorant and destitute of the light of Christianity, as heathen, so to
say, as when the first settler landed on our shores, whose fault is it?
And if they are now fast falling back into the practice of their old
heathen rites, who are responsible for abominations which disgrace the
Christians’ name? Christ died for all; for the African as well as the
European. Have we recognized this fact? Have we come up to the
full measure of the duty we owe to our less favored brother? and when
we found him lying in helpless misery, bruised and beaten,—have we
taken him up and carried him to an inn, and like the good Samaritan,
pored oil into his wounds? or have we not rather, like the unfeeling
priest and cold hearted Levite, passed him by and left him lying by the
way-side, as if <i>his</i> heavenly Father was not ours also? These, dearly
beloved, are questions that we must answer at the judgment seat. “I
was hungry and you gave me not to eat; I was thirsty and you gave
me not to drink: naked and you clothed me not; sick and you did not
visit me;” and the answer will come to you as distinct and definite as to
the astonished culprit, who could not see Christ in the person of the
poor and needy. “Amen, I say to you, as long as you did it not to one
of these least ones, neither did you do it to me.”</p>

<p>Yes, dearly beloved, He who died to redeem us all, will surely hold
us accountable, unless we make such tardy reparation as we are able,
for the wrongs done these neglected creatures, in whose behalf the Church
pleads so earnestly and yet so tenderly to-day. “Now is the acceptable
time; now is the day of salvation.”</p>

<p>What the Church wishes you to do just now is to strengthen the
hands of those noble bands of missionaries—priests of God and devoted
Sisters of Mercy and Charity; heroic Ursulines and brave daughters
of St. Benedict, now laboring among our Colored brethren in the South,
and, in the far West, among the scanty remnants of a race that still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
clings (and who can blame them?) with the tenacity of despair to their
last footholds in a land they once proudly called their own.</p>

<p>The Church, which to the Catholic, is the voice of God, wishes you
to put in the hands of the self-denying workers in that rougher portion
of the Lord’s vineyard, the funds they need to carry on the work they
have in hand. These holy missionaries would carry the glad tidings of
salvation to the benighted children of the forest. They would plant in
their midst schools in which young Indian boys and girls may be trained
in civil learning; and churches into which all may be gathered round
the altar of God, and taught to know and worship in spirit and in truth
Jesus Christ, their Redeemer, whose children they are, and, equally
with us, heirs of eternal life. “Suffer little children to come unto me
and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.” It is the
humility and the meekness of Jesus that is to win for us the great prize
of eternal life for which each one, in his own way, is daily striving.
“Blessed are the meek, for they shall possess the land.” It is the beauty
of our soul not the color of our skin that will be the real test of our right
to gaze upon the glory of God in paradise. “Blessed are the clean of
heart, for they shall see God.”</p>

<p>Such then, in brief, is the object for which this collection is to be taken
up at all the Masses on the First Sunday in Lent—a noble and a blessed
work, and full of richest merit for all who approach it in the spirit of
Christian charity, and with kindly feelings toward those of their brethren,
who, as you know too well, are utterly unable to help themselves.</p>

<p>The heroic self-abnegation of those priests and nuns who have gone
forth into a sort of voluntary exile to spend themselves and be spent for
Christ in the service of the forsaken and despised Indian, whose lot, to
some extent, they share, is worthy of our highest admiration; for this,
Dearly beloved, is not a field of labor which all would willingly select—this
life of perpetual self-sacrifice, ending only in death. The very
nobility of the sacrifice they have made is in itself one of their strongest
claims on your generous support; for (do not forget it), but for this
their heroic self-denial, you would not easily find a means of discharging
a debt you owe a race which for two long centuries has been so cruelly
dealt with;—a race, too, that has proved itself time and again, in council
and on battle field, as brave, as skillful, and as magnanimous as your
own. And yet, to our shame, be it spoken, nearly all that are left of
this singular, and in some respects, mysterious people, are now wanderers
upon the wild prairie, eking out, as best they can, a miserable existence
on the paltry pittance that is doled out to them, and are to-day,
practically speaking, as destitute of religious instructions as were their
pagan forefathers. Oh! Dearly Beloved, what a commentary is this
sad spectacle on the boasted superiority of our Christian civilization!
Take heed, lest Christ’s words on witnessing the faith of the centurion,
and the want of it on the part of those to whom He was speaking, may
one day rise up in judgment against you: “I say to you that many
shall come from the East and the West, and shall sit down with Abraham
and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven; but the children of the
kingdom shall be cast out into exterior darkness: there shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.”</p>

<p>Come, then, We entreat you in the bowels of Christ’s mercy;—in the
name of Him who for your sakes, and for the sake of those for whom
We are pleading, hung naked on the cross, despising the shame; come
to the aid of these devoted missionaries who are doing what they can
to save this people worthy of a better fate; remembering the rich graces
poured out centuries ago on your own ancestors in the faith; for what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
after all, are these brave missionaries doing, but just what St. Patrick
did for Ireland, St. Boniface for Germany, St. Francis Xavier for the
savage tribes of India, and St. Francis of Sales, the gentle apostle of
the Swiss, for the tens of thousand whom he rescued from the enemy
of souls.</p>

<p>Dearly beloved, a glorious work is going on in your midst and you
know it not. If, then, you hear the voice of God to-day, harden not
your hearts; turn not a deaf ear to the voice pleading within you for
your destitute Colored and Indian Brethren; but take in hand at once
the blessed work which your generous hearts prompt you to do. Rise
up like true men, and shake off the forgetfulness of the past, and let
your charity respond in full measure to this earnest appeal to you for
help. It comes to you with the sanction of grave and venerable prelates
who in council have weighed the matter well, and now make known to
you the obligation you are under. The rich results of your generosity
you may not live to see. Leave that to God. The just man lives by
faith, and knows that if in loving kindness to the poor and destitute he
casts his bread upon the waters, it will come back to him, not in the
shape of human praise, but in the fullness of divine mercy, which will
not be wanting to him in that supreme hour when he will stand most in
need of it. Strive thus, dearly beloved, to make your vocation and
election sure; that, for your kindness to the needy, you may one day
hear those words so full of comfort and divine love: “Come ye blessed
of My Father, possess the kingdom prepared for you; for I was hungry
and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me to drink;
I was naked and you clothed me; sick, and you visited me; for as long
as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to Me.
Enter into the joy of your Lord.”</p>

<p>You will have the sweet consolation of knowing that you have hearkened
to the voice of the Bishops whom the Holy Ghost has placed over
the Church in this our beloved country—this favored land which is ours
by so many pleasing associations;—discovered by a fearless Catholic
navigator, aided, as he was in turn, by the royal munificence of that
pearl of Christian Queens, “Isabella the Catholic;”—its early missionaries
devoted sons of St. Dominic, St. Francis and St. Ignatius, who were the
first to plant the cross and spread the true faith on American soil, which
they watered with their blood;—this blessed land of ours now dedicated
to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and tenderly guarded by our dear Lady,
the Immaculate Mother of our God, and sweet comforter of the afflicted.</p>

<p>Dearly beloved, may the joy of a good conscience, the peace of God,
that peace that surpasseth all understanding, ever be yours.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Baltimore, Md.</span></h3>

<p>The Catholic Church in the Southern States has long felt the need
of priests. The Bishops of these States have made successive appeals
for zealous workers, but all to no purpose. St. Joseph’s Seminary and
the Epiphany Apostolic College have been founded to supply this want.
Although both institutions are new, sixty-five young men have offered
themselves for the arduous mission. If Providence favors this Seminary
and College a number of missionaries will depart yearly for the
South, to work wholly in the spiritual interests of the Negro. “On
sending in our application,” writes the Rev. Rector of St. Joseph’s
Seminary, “it may be well to review the work of the scholastic year,
1891-92, at St. Joseph’s Seminary and the Epiphany Apostolic College.
The most important event, the placing of our work on an independent
basis, is already known to you. We are seven priests to initiate the
new movement. We have just finished a retreat in common in which
we threw ourselves into shape under the name of St. Joseph’s Society
of the Sacred Heart. The seven represented the two institutions for
the training of missionaries, the missions of Richmond, Va., Wilmington,
Del., and St. Peter Claver’s mission of Baltimore. In regard to
this step, very many Bishops and Priests, by word and letter, have
endorsed it. The second event of importance was the ordination of
our colored priest, in December, 1891. At the close of the year there
were ten seminarians at St. Joseph’s Seminary and fifty-two students at
the Epiphany Apostolic College. Of our seminarians, one is a deacon,
one is in minor orders, and three are tonsured. With God’s blessing
and our Lady’s help, next year will see fifteen seminarians in St. Joseph’s
Seminary, of whom six will have been graduates of the Epiphany Apostolic
College. We expect to have at least sixty students in the latter
institution. Your Eminence will bear in mind that the five thousand
dollars the venerable Commission has agreed to allow us, are but one
fifth of our expenses. And it is but just to add that we must raise the
other four-fifths. Moreover, we must build a new seminary this year.
At present, the neighboring house, one hundred and thirty feet distant,
must be used, and we fear to the detriment of discipline. Plans are
drawn for a building to hold sixty seminarians. Because of this building
may we ask a special donation in addition to the regular allotment?
The new seminary will cost sixty thousand dollars, which, as I must
stand at my post, I know not how to raise.”</p>

<p>The following letter is from the Rev. Paul Griffith, of St. Augustine’s
Church, Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>“I most respectfully apply for assistance from the fund for the Indian
and Negro Missions. We need all the help possible to cope with the
Public Schools of Washington. In fact our school facilities are poor,
and unless we can do something to invite children to our Catholic
school, many of them will lose their faith. Five hundred dollars are
absolutely necessary to pay the teachers, but one thousand would be
a veritable Godsend.”</p>

<p>Sister Rose Noylam, who has charge of St. Euphemia’s School,
Emmitsburg, Md., writes as follows, in a letter addressed to His Eminence,
Cardinal Gibbons: “I make a new appeal for our poor colored
children. At the same time I wish to thank Your Eminence for last
year’s appropriation; although it was one hundred dollars less than
that of the year before, still we are most grateful for it. There are from
forty to fifty colored children enrolled in our school, and it is both consoling
and edifying to witness the docility of these little ones, and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
eagerness to make all manner of sacrifices to avail themselves of the
advantages of an education. Some of these children have to walk
three miles to school and three more in returning to their homes.
They come to school in all varieties of weather, through snow and ice,
to say nothing of the other discomforts to be met with on the rugged
roads of the surrounding district.”</p>

<p>The Rev. C. G. Giesen, pastor of St. Francis Xavier’s Colored
Church, City of Baltimore, had many difficulties to contend against in
the running of his large parochial school. “Four hundred colored
children receive tuition free. I shall give the amount of expenses and
receipts for 1891.”</p>

<p>The Rev. A. B. Leeson, of St. Monica’s Colored Church, writes as
follows: “Next year we shall have to exert all the influence in our
power to hold our school. Within two doors of our school a large
public school building is being erected.” This new public school
building will draw pupils away from the Catholic school unless the
latter be made equally efficient in its work. This means an increase
of expenditure.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Charleston, S. C.</span></h3>

<p>The diocese of Charleston has a large negro population out of which
a thousand are counted as Catholics. This is a goodly number, when
we consider the fact, that there are but eight thousand Catholics in the
whole diocese. The Ordinary of the diocese, Bishop Northrop, has
this to say in reference to the Negro Missions: “This poor diocese has
bought and given for the use of the colored people, since the war, the
following property: a church valued at $7,000, a residence at $3,500, a
school-house at $4,500, a chapel at $3,500. This makes a total
expenditure of $18,500. The fathers hitherto in charge of the Negro
Missions, have done their best, I suppose, but the results of their work
are not satisfactory. We have the names of a thousand colored
Catholics on the rolls, but no more than four hundred actually attend
church. The support derived from them is extremely meagre. Notwithstanding
this we have supported two churches, one priest, sometimes
two, and kept the school going with three excellent teachers. I have
delayed my report while trying to secure a successor to the late Rev.
Cornelius Hurley, who died last April. After various unsuccessful
efforts, I have made a contract with the Fathers of the Pious Society of
Missions, and expect two priests in a short while. I hope by next year
to be able to report progress. Father Hurley was sick for a year or
more and the mission suffered very much. The Josephites were unable
to give me any assistance, and just after resigning the mission Father<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Hurley died. I have kept the Church and School open since then, not
without great inconvenience and considerable personal expense. After
the arrival of the priests, whose coming I expect, I can give a better
outline of my prospects for the future. I have a building valued at
$5,000, situated near the Church and the School. This I propose to
repair and arrange for Sisters devoted to the Colored work. It will
serve as an Academy and Orphanage. These repairs will cost about a
thousand dollars. If I succeed in procuring the services of Sisters, I
expect your generous aid. The Church and School now call for at
least $1,000 for support, the income being only $500. A new church
at the Cross-roads will, I hope, be an event of the future.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chicago, Ill.</span></h3>

<p>There are 35,000 Negroes in the city of Chicago; of which number
about 500 are Catholics. The latter are now permanently organized
and form a parish having for its pastor, the colored priest, Rev. A.
Tolton. A building site has been procured in a good location and
Father Tolton is exerting himself to raise funds for the erection of a
church. A colored school is badly needed and could be made the
instrument for the accomplishing of much good. Father Tolton is sure
of the attendance of at least one hundred Catholic children, while he
feels confident that two or three hundred colored Protestant children
would seek admittance. The colored people in most localities are very
partial to parochial schools conducted by sisters.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Covington, Ky.</span></h3>

<p>The diocese of Covington has but few colored Catholics, yet the
schools and charitable institutions founded by Bishop Maes, promise in
time to bear rich fruitage. St. Peter Claver’s school in Lexington has
a membership of 219 pupils; of this number 202 are protestants. The
salutary influence of the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, as exerted over
the children intrusted to their keeping, will necessarily tend to turn the
eyes of the parents towards the Church. Besides this school, there is
in the same city, a hospital for colored people under the charge of the
Sisters of Charity. Last year it admitted 142 patients. Another
hospital in Covington cared for 42 patients last year, five of whom were
received into the Church. “Your committee will notice that we have
kept our own,” writes the Bishop of Covington. “Solid results already
attained are the only claims we bring forward to support our application
for the same amount of help as has been given us in the past, and if
possible a greater amount. You will kindly notice, that so far, I have
been unable to contribute a single cent towards the maintenance
of the 184 feeble and sick colored people in our hospitals; and that the
same lack of funds prevents me from taxing the charity of our orphan
asylums to a greater extent than is already done. The prospects for
permanent good done to souls at Lexington, are as bright as ever, as is
proved by results, and will in my opinion assume a brighter aspect every
year. I would like to begin, in Covington itself, to enlarge the sphere
of negro work, but property being expensive and the resources small, I
forebear, of least for this year. The following record of receipts and
expenditures will give some insight into our work and its needs.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Galveston, Texas.</span></h3>

<p>The diocese of Galveston presents a great field for missionary labor.
Its Negro population, aggregating a quarter of a million, knows almost
nothing of the saving truths of Catholicity. The five hundred colored
Catholics within the limits of the diocese are scattered here and there and
are thus unable, as a body, to possess or exert any influence over their
brethren. A church has been erected for the colored people, two
schools have been opened, an orphanage founded, while two priests
have volunteered their services for the good work. This is a good
beginning. “The laudable work in behalf of the colored people in this
diocese still goes on,” writes Bishop Gallagher, “and with fair success,
notwithstanding the many obstacles to be met with, and the constant
opposition of many ill-disposed toward our Holy Faith, especially the
colored ministers, who in various ways strive to keep the colored people
from our churches, and the colored children from our schools. The
white people, in general, manifest little interest in our efforts to benefit
the colored race; and even Catholics give little aid or encouragement
to this good work. It seems evident, therefore, that the conversion of
the colored people here, under ordinary circumstances, will be a work
of time. The colored Catholics, being mixed with Protestants and
surrounded by them, need a great deal of fortitude to withstand the
evil influences about them. But in time, with the blessing of God,
under the protection of our Blessed Lady of the Rosary, we hope to
see the colored people coming into the true fold in large numbers. I
feel sure that earnest prayer and zealous labor now will bring success
later. To carry out the various projects we propose to realize during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
the coming year, we shall need $1,691.73 to pay the debt on Holy
Rosary Church, Galveston, and on St. Nicholas School, Houston. We
also need $800 to meet the current expenses of this Church and School.
An addition to this, the priest’s house attached to this Church is badly
needed. This improvement would cost $1,000. We would like to
build a school-house for colored children at Austin. This building
could be built for $1,200. To continue the work going on and to pay
our debts, I request the usual allowance for Galveston. A short while
ago I administered the Sacrament of Confirmation to seventeen colored
people; this indicates about the results of our efforts here in Galveston
in the work of evangelizing the Negroes.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Kansas City, Kansas.</span></h3>

<p>The Rt. Rev. L. M. Fink of Kansas City, submits the following
communication touching the mission work in his diocese. It will be
found interesting.</p>

<p>“The number of colored Catholics has not been notably increased
during the past year. About one-half of the adults baptized since the
last report obtained that grace in <i>articulo mortis</i>. Prejudice and
ignorance will, however, be gradually removed, it is hoped, and then
the work will go on more rapidly. Our schools are quite satisfactory,
both in point of attendance and in the progress made by pupils in their
studies. The Guardian Angel Asylum is a very promising institution,
and well worthy of all encouragement. Here colored children, in their
tender years, imbibe the principles and practices of Christianity. Aloof
from all contaminating influences, their dispositions are carefully regulated,
their minds cultivated, in a word, they are wisely prepared to
become faithful Christians and useful members of an enlightened community.
The buildings now occupied are entirely inadequate for the work.
Many of Christ’s little ones must grow up in filth and ignorance and sin,
because they who are otherwise so able and willing to keep them, lack
the means of providing ample accommodations for the helpless and forsaken.
One thousand dollars are needed for the ensuing year to keep
up the Sisters’ schools at Leavenworth and Topeka, make an addition
to the Colored Orphan Asylum at Leavenworth, and furnish part of support
to one priest.”</p>

<p>From a letter of Bishop Fink, accompanying his report to the Commission,
we quote the following: “Last year I felt very much discouraged;
this year I feel more encouraged. We have again a very good
school for colored children at Leavenworth. We have about twenty-five
colored boys in our orphan asylum. The building being too small,
we were unable to take in any girls. In order to give room to those we
have, and to take in a few more, we have to put an addition to our present
accommodations. This will entail an expense of some $500. I do
not dare to ask for more than a thousand— which will leave a small sum
at my disposal to support two schools, the Colored Sisters and give a
fractional salary to the priest, who is almost exclusively engaged in the
colored work at Leavenworth. We have not recuperated from the loss
we sustained at Topeka, by the Oklahoma exodus, about two years ago.
Besides adding a sanctuary to the school-house, separated by folding
doors, so as to give the colored people divine service on some Sunday
evenings, nothing more was done, except to keep up the colored school.
If I could have any hope of getting for once only, an appropriation of
$3000, or $4000, I would feel encouraged to put the Orphan Asylum for
colored children on a firmer basis. For this purpose I would have to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
secure a site in the country, with a sufficient piece of land, to train the
children to work and make the institution self-supporting in the course
of a few years. My diocese is poor; it receives the poor from the eastern
cities and towns. For these we try to do the best we can, but they do
not become wealthy or able to give much help even to their own churches
and schools, much less to the Negro cause. Even if they would like to
be generous, as many of them try to be, still they are unable to contribute
much. Thus in other words, I can expect very little, if any, help from
my own diocese. We have a large Negro population in Kansas City,
perhaps some 6000 souls, among whom there are not over one half
dozen Catholics. As soon as our missions become self-sustaining, a
beginning can be made here. I have not a sufficient number of priests
at present for the whites, let alone the means.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Little Rock, Arkansas.</span></h3>

<p>Bishop Fitzgerald, of Little Rock, feels sanguine of the future success
of Catholic Missionary work in his diocese. “There is at the present
time a somewhat better prospect for conversions than existed last year,
as the colored people begin to see that we mean them good, not harm.
The most flourishing school is at Pine Bluff. Here the usual common-school
branches are taught, together with music, vocal and instrumental.
The girls are taught sewing, domestic work, etc., and the boys, carpentry.
Three Sisters of Charity are employed as teachers; and also an
instructor in carpentry and building. The Hot Springs’ School is also
doing well. In our five schools we have four hundred and fifty pupils
enrolled. On the whole, I feel more encouraged than when I last wrote.
We have not as yet been able to open a school at Little Rock. The
colored people here are superabundantly supplied with schools, public
and private. The Colored Industrial School, although but three years,
founded, is a pronounced success. The attendance is much larger than
usual, and promises to reach, when cotton picking time is over, two
hundred and fifty pupils. In a few years it is hoped that a farm will be
procured, and a full course of trades and farm work gradually developed.”</p>

<p>“It is desired by the Directors, Teachers and Patrons of the school to
commemorate the great centennial year of 1892, by the erection of a
home for the Sisters of Charity, a little church for the people and a
small house for the pastor. There are 350,000 colored people in
Arkansas, the greater part in the cotton Belt Region, of which Pine Bluff
is the centre, and there is not one Catholic church for colored people in the
whole State. Before the war many of the colored people were Catholics,
but have fallen away from the church through want of that attention, which
the poverty of the diocese could not grant them. A great number would
now gladly return if a proper chance was offered. At present, Mass is
held every Sunday in St. Joseph’s Church for their special benefit.
While they have always been invited to attend the regular services of
the church here and elsewhere in the State, they have, as a rule, refused
to do so, owing to the fear of feeling on the part of the whites, and the
demands of the regular congregation. With the great success of the
school and the sympathy of both colored and white citizens, we feel,
that we are offering a rare opportunity to the charitably disposed. We,
therefore, most earnestly request all friends of the colored people to send
us a donation, large or small, to aid us in this great work. The usual
masses and prayers will be offered for all benefactors.” An interesting
history of this school will be found in last year’s report of “The Negro
and Indian Commission.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Louisville, Ky.</span></h3>

<p>There are 4003 colored Catholics in the diocese of Louisville. Eight
special schools for colored children are in good running order, with an
enrollment of 680 pupils. These schools are under the direction of the
Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, of Loretto and of lay teachers. The
colored Catholics of Louisville have a church of their own, attended by
a regular priest of the Josephite order. Two hundred and four baptisms
have been reported during the last year.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mobile, Ala.</span></h3>

<p>According to the late census there are 706,243 colored people in the
diocese of Mobile. About 2,500 of this vast number are Catholics. The
total Catholic population, negroes and whites included, is scarcely 17,000
souls. These figures will give us some slight idea of the difficulty to be
met with on every side in the work of propagating the faith. Priests,
money and moral support are absolutely necessary to achieve any missionary
success. Bishop O’Sullivan has five colored schools directed by
the Sisters of Mercy and by lay teachers. Two hundred and thirty-five
pupils attended them. “These schools do much good. The attendance
would be larger if they were entirely free. In our present circumstances
I think it advisable to exact a small fee for tuition. People do not always
appreciate what they get for nothing. The children are well instructed
in the catechism and make good progress in their studies. Through the
children we hope to lead the parents to the church. We have at last
opened the mission for colored people in Pensacola. Father Fullerton
generously took charge of the work. We have a church and school
combined. It is a frame building, two stories high, 75 feet by 32 feet.
The first story is used for school purposes and the second as a church.
The Sisters of Mercy teach the school. The building was blessed
December 4th, there being large congregations present at the three services.
The church is under the patronage of St. Joseph. I am more
than hopeful for the success of this mission. We need a house for the
Pastor and as the church is yet to be built we have secured a lot in a fine
situation. We receive very few adult converts from among the colored
people. However, the proportion of colored converts is equal to the
number of white converts. Hence, there is no good reason why we
should look on the conversion of the colored people as hopeless; on the
contrary, the outlook is encouraging. If we plant the good seed, our
successors will reap a rich harvest. We must work and wait and pray
until the Lord sends the harvest. The Catholics in the South are so
few, that it is impossible for them to supply missionaries and means to
carry on the work. Help must come from outside. May God bless all
who help in this mission.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Nashville, Tenn.</span></h3>

<p>There is but forty colored Catholics in this diocese. The colored
population numbers 434,320. The contrast is very striking. The
diocese has suffered much on account of the Civil War and the terrible
yellow fever plagues that ravaged the South in 1867, 1873, ’78 and ’79.
These successive plagues carried off twenty priests and many religious,
dealing a blow, from the effects of which the diocese has not as yet been
able to recover. There is one special school for the colored people.
It is located in Memphis and has a membership of 167 pupils. Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Rademacher writes that in regard to this school, Father Moran, of St.
Peter’s Church, informs him that the progress of the pupils is very encouraging.
“Towards the close of the term, however, the ‘Oklahoma
fever’ attacked our colored people and many of those who went out
there were the parents of our children, and of course we lost those
children. The tendency of the colored people to roam about is one of
the chief obstacles to the success of the school. The race trouble in
Memphis last Spring had also an injurious effect. The experience of the
last four years has not been very encouraging. ‘I believe’ says Father
Moran, ‘we are removing prejudice and gradually convincing the colored
people that the Church is honestly trying to do something for them. The
children are taught the catechism and prayers and are making satisfactory
progress in them. But for good and sufficient reason, it has not
been deemed prudent to receive, as yet, any of them into the church.’”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Natchez, Mississippi.</span></h3>

<p>In the State of Mississippi the negroes out-number the whites. The
Catholic population of the whole State numbers but 15,000, out of which
1838 are colored. There is perhaps one colored Catholic in every seven
hundred of the population. Five colored schools are kept open with
an average attendance of about two hundred children. These schools
are in charge of religious. Bishop Heslin has a wide field for work.
One of his priests, a very zealous man, is engaged exclusively in Negro
Mission work. This priest, the Rev. A. N. Peters, has just purchased
a plot of ground in a locality easily accessible to the colored people.
“This will entail additional expense,” writes Bishop Heslin, “as almost
every building that is required will have to be built new, and the old
place cannot be disposed of at once. The Rev. Father will have to seek
help to enable him to erect church, school, convent and parsonage and
to provide himself with a means of livelihood.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Natchitoches, La.</span></h3>

<p>The colored Catholics of this diocese number 15,000, or about half
the total Catholic population. Bishop Durrier is doing his utmost to
extend the work of Catholic education. The six schools within his
diocese have been founded through aid granted him by the Commission.</p>

<p>In a letter forwarded to the Commission the bishop writes: “I ask for
the same allocation as that granted me last year, $2000. This year I did
not succeed in doing for Catholic education all that I wished. I hope
to do better the coming year. I have re-opened the school at Bayou
Wallace which we were forced to close last year. The prospects of the
work hardly show a bright spot; yet the work can stand on the principle,
that the salvation of a single soul is worth both any amount of money
and any amount of labor. The work will keep going on. I have no
special observation to submit to the Commission. I simply surmise
that in the fight for the Catholic education of the colored people, the
Commission ought to give the honors of war, even to those who come
out from the battle field badly beaten, provided they ‘never despair of
the Republic.’ The progress we have made is not so encouraging as I
had expected. Still, I believe in trying and trying again.”</p>

<p>This determination to succeed has the true ring to it; Bishop Durrier’s
motto will always bear him out. “What <i>ought</i> to be done, <i>must</i> and
<i>shall</i> be done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">New Orleans, La.</span></h3>

<p>The diocese of New Orleans still continues to lead in the work of
Negro education. There are 80,000 colored Catholics in the diocese,
36 schools open to colored children, a large orphan asylum and a home
for aged women. The schools are attended by over 2309 pupils. Two
or three extra schools are opened each year. Archbishop Janssens feels
confident of the future good results to come from his labor, in multiplying
these colored schools. His pithy letter is extremely interesting.</p>

<p>“This year I notice a decrease in infant baptisms. One year there are
more, another less. An average of a certain number of years would
enable us to draw a conclusion either one way or the other. During the
last year our schools have been increased by four new ones while we
note an increased attendance of 404 pupils. This is a consoling item.
There is a strong desire on the part of both priests and sisters to perform
their full duty towards colored schools. In many of our parishes the
priests are anxious to open schools, but the poverty of the parishes does
not allow it. If we had $20,000 to spend on this item alone, it would
not be adequate, by any means, to present and pressing wants. However,
we are making arrangements to open three schools, two of which will
draw a very large number of pupils, they being situated in parishes
largely made up of colored people. We have two churches especially
for colored people. One of these, at Petite Prairie, has long since existed
but I was not aware of it, until I made a visit there last year. One new
Orphan Asylum is so far finished that we have been able to transfer our
orphan girls there. It has cost $16,747, on which is a debt of $4000.
God’s Providence has visibly assisted us in this work. When the debt
is paid, we will furnish it according to plan, thus entailing a cost of $8000
more. It is of brick, simple but beautiful style, strongly constructed, well
ventilated, with a capacity for 150 orphans. This Asylum, more than
anything else, has lifted up our colored population in the city. They
feel grateful to the Church for it. At the laying of the corner stone, the
different colored societies paraded and there were about 7000 colored
people in and around the premises, besides many whites. The old
Asylum has been fitted up at an expense of $1200, (no debt) and our
aged colored women have it for a home. It is able to accommodate
about fifty people. The year 1891, has been remarkable in the history
of the Church’s progress in this diocese, both for white and colored
Catholics. <i>Deo Gratias.</i></p>

<p>“Last September I made a pastoral visit to the chapel at Petite Prairie.
The road leads through swamps and is abominable in bad weather. We
were favored by a clear sky. Thirty colored cavaliers came to meet us,
to conduct us to the chapel, an old store, in a rather dilapidated condition.
The chapel was full to overflowing and the people delighted.
I confirmed sixty-nine colored people. This is an exclusively colored
settlement, most of its inhabitants being free-men before the war. They
are industrious, intelligent and very much devoted to the church and
religion. Here there are about 500 Catholics, but owing to the distance
from the church and the many occupations of the Pastor they have
Mass but once a month on a week-day. I was really surprised to find
the children, when examined, so well instructed in their religion. They
are anxious to have a resident priest, a school and a new church. But
where are the laborers? In another portion of the diocese, at Grossetete
Bayou, there is a somewhat smaller settlement of negroes, who before
the war, were sold in Maryland to Louisiana Protestant Planters. The
history of their trials for religion, their constancy to the faith, would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
embellish a page in the history of the Martyrs of the Church. Much is
said of the inconstancy of the negro, but my experience convinces me,
that where the negro has been brought up in the knowledge and practice
of religion, he is as constant as any white Catholic under the circumstances.
Bad training and ignorance degenerate their mind and heart
as it does with the white population. We are trying to raise means to
build a church for that settlement. I regret very much that the Commission
has been obliged to diminish the allocation. Our work is
increasing and the funds diminishing. May the Lord provide some
other means.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">New York, N. Y.</span></h3>

<p>The diocese of New York has 80,000 colored people within its limits.
The vast majority of these dwell on the Bermuda Islands which are
under Archbishop Corrigan’s jurisdiction. In New York City there are
3000 colored Catholics, with one church devoted to their use. Their
spiritual interests are cared for by two priests of the diocese. Two Benedictine
Fathers are in charge at Nassau. A flourishing “school and
home” has been opened at Rye, N. Y., which is directed by ten Dominican
Sisters. The three schools at Nassau are well spoken of as will be
seen by the following letter. The Sisters of Charity have charge of
them. The labor of these two Sisterhoods in this arduous mission
work has been untiring. The Sisters of Charity have devoted their
energies to the colored people without remuneration, and have been
supported by the zeal and generosity of the Mother House at Mount St.
Vincent’s.</p>

<p>The following interesting letter is from Archbishop Corrigan:</p>

<p>“I have the pleasure of returning to you the blank form with regard to
the colored Missions. The Rev. Jno. E. Burke, of St. Benedict’s Home,
has given the facts relating to his Mission, and I myself add a few details
regarding the Mission at Nassau, which I visited last month for the purpose
of administering the Sacrament of Confirmation. I found our
Free Schools to be the best on the Island. They are attended by over
200 children, all of them negroes, and nearly all non-catholics. Their
parents are anxious that these children should have the benefit of a good
education, and especially of that training and gentleness which is imparted
by devoted religious teachers. The Sisters who conduct the schools are
popular with all classes of the community. During my stay at Nassau,
I visited the schools several times, in company with other clergymen,
and was a witness to the surprising proficiency of the pupils, and was
present at an exhibition given by the colored children, which was
attended by the most distinguished residents of Nassau. Among them
were Sir Ambrose and Lady Shea, the Colonial Secretary, Captain
Jackson and his wife, the Attorney General and the Chief Justice.
They unanimously expressed themselves as surprised and pleased beyond
measure with the results obtained in so short a time from such unpromising
material. Later on this exhibition was repeated for the parents of the
pupils, much to their delight and gratification.</p>

<p>“The hope of the future of this Mission is in the schools, and, therefore,
with God’s blessing it is proposed this year to erect another building,
in order to accommodate the large number of applicants, whom we are
now obliged to refuse. During the month of November, 1891, a kindergarten
was opened in Nassau. It is already overcrowded. We
propose to receive young children in this kindergarten, and then
gradually lead them on to the other branches of an ordinary education.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Religious instruction is regularly given, and I assisted one Sunday at the
Sunday School, which was composed almost entirely of non-catholics,
who went there of their own accord, and who answered the catechism
in such a way as might bring a blush to many of our more favored
children.</p>

<p>“Recently a second Benedictine Father sailed for Nassau to assist Rev.
Father Chrysostom, O. S. B., who is in charge of the Mission. On the
whole, I felt very well repaid for the discomforts of the journey by sea
and the distance traveled, (nearly 2400 miles altogether), on witnessing
the results already accomplished. I had the pleasure of confirming 20
children and adults, all of whom, except one, were colored, and all of
whom except this one, were converts. On Holy Saturday Father
Chrysostom expects to baptize 20 more Neophytes. As the colored
Catholics of Nassau are few and poor, it is impossible for them to contribute
to the support of the Mission, so that for the present it must be
carried on as a labor of christian love and self-sacrifice. There are
many hardships connected with the Mission, particularly in the long
summer months when the thermometer rises to 160 degrees in the sun.
There are privations in the way of obtaining proper food, as the fresh
meats and fresh vegetables must be imported from this city and communication
is rare from the month of May to November. However,
the Grace of God enables the good missionaries and the devoted sisters
to endure these difficulties and to bear them cheerfully for the glory of
His name.”</p>

<p>The New York City Mission carries a large debt on the Home for
Destitute Colored Children, located at Rye. It receives children from
other dioceses. One hundred children are now cared for and educated
within its walls. Father Burke who is at its head asks the Commission
for $1500. Besides this, the building of a new school at Nassau is
deemed necessary, thus calling for an outlay of about $2000. The
prospects for future good in this diocese look encouraging.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">North Carolina.</span></h3>

<p>Bishop Haid has many unfavorable conditions to encounter in his
large vicariate. The Catholics both white and colored are few and
scattered. Every step he would make in the right direction is hampered
by the poverty of the diocese. We give his letter to the Negro
and Indian Commission: “The Colored Missions in North Carolina, have
made some progress, but not such as I could have wished. With the
means at our disposal, we should perhaps not expect too much. St.
Charles’ Church at Newbern, is finished. Rev. M. Haw has Divine
Service there every Sunday for the colored People. He seems greatly
interested in the work, and has a considerable class ready for Confirmation.
The Sisters of Mercy teach the colored school and have from
88 to 100 pupils enrolled. At Wilmington the colored Catholics attend
St. Thomas’ Church and are very regular. The Sisters of Mercy teach
the school which numbers about 100 pupils. This year we may increase
our school room. St. Benedict’s colored church, near the Abbey, is
under the charge of good Father Melchior, who exerts himself to the
utmost. The school connected with this church was taught by a lay
teacher last year. This year the Sisters of Mercy from the Sacred Heart
Academy will take charge of it. Until I procure more priests, or better,
until I procure priests ready to devote themselves altogether to the
colored people, little more can be done than what we are now trying to
do. If some community of Sisters would establish a house for the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
and infirm in some large town, I believe they could do a world of good;
as the older people are more thoughtful, they would gladly open their
hearts to our Holy Faith on beholding Faith practised in Charity. I
trust you will continue your generous aid to the colored people of
North Carolina.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Philadelphia, Pa.</span></h3>

<p>In last year’s report a full account was given of the purchase and
opening of a church for colored Catholics in Philadelphia. “From the
results attained since then” writes the Rev. Jas. Nolan, “there is every
reason to believe that the colored Mission in Philadelphia will eventually
prove a success. Nothing could be more encouraging than the large
number of young men and women who have, within the last year
returned to the practice of their religion. For years they had strayed
away; they had but rarely attended church and were never known to
approach the sacraments. Now they approach the sacraments and are
ardently attached to their church. I have no doubt that each succeeding
year may bring many more to follow their example.</p>

<p>“Lack of funds, unfortunately is a great drawback to the mission, there
is still a debt of $10,000 on the church, the interest payable half-yearly.
Moreover, we have other heavy expenses for schools, light, heat, water,
etc. These matters often prevent us from paying as much attention to
the spiritual side of the work as is really necessary. The schools are
well attended and through them we hope to reap in due time an abundant
harvest. I earnestly hope your venerable Commission will give
me this year a substantial subsidy to enable me to realize at least some
of the great good that can be done among so large a population of
colored people.”</p>

<p>Sister Agnes Mary, superioress of the Convent of Notre Dame, writes
of the colored school for girls, as follows:</p>

<p>“In sending in our claim for a share in the annual distribution in favor
of colored schools, we present the Committee with a report of the Girl’s
colored school under our care at Ninth and Pine Sts. The school opened
in September last with an attendance of 68; but owing to sickness
and other causes, the number was decreased by 10 or 12, so that at the
close of the school, June 23, there were about 56 present. One-half are
Catholics. We have had the consolation of seeing many who had been
negligent in the discharge of their religious duties, resume their former
fervor, and become monthly communicants. The pupils have given
general satisfaction. One convert has been received into the church.
As many Catholic children are drawn to public schools by the inducement
of books free of charge, we are obliged to use the same bait, and
furnish them with sewing material, books and other school requisites.”
The boy’s school is conducted in the basement of the church, (St. Peter
Claver’s) by Brothers of the Society of the Holy Ghost. This school
has an average attendance of 80 pupils.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pittsburgh, Pa.</span></h3>

<p>The spiritual interests of the colored Catholics of Pittsburgh are
looked after by the Rev. John Griffin, C. S. Sp., who resides at Holy
Ghost College in that city. A church was erected last year, in the
basement of which a school has been opened, conducted by two Sisters
of Mercy. Its average attendance is about fifty pupils. “We greatly
need pecuniary support” writes Father Griffin “in order to pay off the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
debt still due on our parochial property. There is no pastoral residence
near the church, and this for want of means to purchase one. The
priest attending the colored church, has to reside at a considerable
distance from it. The good effected, though perhaps not so rapid and
consoling as might be found in other kinds of charitable enterprises, is
still real and substantial. We hope that those who have power, influence
and means, will extend a kindly, helping hand to the poor priest, to
whose lot it has fallen to take upon his weak shoulders this difficult,
uphill work.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Richmond, Va.</span></h3>

<p>In this diocese live 700,000 negroes. Out of this number 700 are
classed as Catholics. One Catholic in every 1000. This is certainly a
good field for zealous missionaries. One priest only is engaged in the
colored work. Six schools are in operation with an enrollment of
about four hundred pupils. The Sisters of St. Francis and the Sisters
of the Holy Cross have charge of them. Rev. P. J. Oud, a Josephite
father, writes to the Commission as follows: “During the coming year
we hope to open new missions. Several localities are clamoring for
schools, but we have not the means. In the past, as well as now, we are
mainly depending upon the money, kindly granted us by the Commission
for the distribution of the Negro and Indian fund.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">San Antonio, Texas.</span></h3>

<p>A letter from Rev. R. J. Molony about the work being done among
the Negroes of this diocese has already been cited.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Savannah, Ga.</span></h3>

<p>Nearly one-half of the population of this diocese are colored. There
are 1000 colored Catholics out of the total number of 20,000 Catholics
to be found in the State. The colored people have five Catholic schools
open to them, and one church in Savannah which is regularly attended
by a priest. “It seems to me” writes Bishop Becker, “that the colored
people need to be taught less in schools, and a great deal more in
individual work. They have a notion that the sovereign panacea for all
their woes is to be able to read and write a little, and learn something of
figures. They believe that such knowledge would somehow keep them
from being obliged to work. The orphan Asylum for colored children
is wholly dependent on our help, except for what the girls may get for
working. I would gladly do all in my power to aid the colored people
suitably. It is my well founded belief, that without an ‘Industrial School’
under some Brothers, like the Xavieran for instance, very little permanent
good can be effected. With utterly inadequate means we are doing
what we can.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">St. Augustine, Fla.</span></h3>

<p>The Rt. Rev. Bishop Moore, of St. Augustine, presents his views on
the condition of Negro Mission work in his diocese, in an interesting
letter which we give in full.— “This month one year ago the convent and
school of the Sisters of St. Joseph, in Jacksonville, were burned and have
not since been rebuilt. I should like to rebuild a school for the colored
children at a cost of about $500. This would suit very well until the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Sisters are able to rebuild their convent. In Tampa the Jesuits are
desirous of establishing a colored school and I should like to give them
$500 for that object. The $7700 I have heretofore received has paid for
the block of ground which I have secured for school, church and presbytery
for the colored people. Over $400 are left over to go towards
the building. As I would have that building to serve for a school, a
hall for meetings, and perhaps for a church temporarily, I believe I
should not erect one that would cost less than three or four thousand
dollars. Hence, I propose to wait until I shall have a sum approximating
that amount before I undertake to build; and I would express the hope
of receiving a generous contribution from the collection this year.
Although I feel much discouraged by the accounts I hear of the partial
failure of separate churches for the colored people in other parts of the
South, I am determined to make the experiment in St. Augustine this
year; but I desire to make it after my own idea— I desire to have for
the colored Catholics the best and most attractive church in the place,
one of which they will be proud. I desire to have it so situated that the
grounds will allow of public processions on Palm Sunday, Corpus Christi
and other festivals of the church. I hope in that way to retain the
Catholics we have and to win over others.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Wilmington, Del.</span></h3>

<p>The Rev. J. A. de Ruyter, a zealous Josephite Father who has accomplished
much good in Wilmington writes: “By advice of the Rt. Rev.
A. A. Curtis and very Rev. J. R. Slattery, an asylum for negro orphan
boys has just been opened. For this purpose I have given up the priest’s
house. Next to it we have a plot of ground on which to build. This
is the only exclusive boys’ orphan asylum for Catholic negroes. Orphan
boys from all dioceses will be admitted. We need much help to supply
this long-felt great want. A plot of ground at Cape Charles City,
donated to me by a protestant gentleman, needs a little chapel and
school combined. We have no means to carry out this desire. Chestertown,
Md. and Elkton, Md., need the same. We are ready and anxious
to carry out the mission work, but we have no means to do it. I request
an allowance of $3000 this year. This sum is badly needed.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Arizona.</span></h3>

<p>The following communication is from the Rt. Rev. Bishop P.
Bourgade, of Arizona. “The Indian work here is so limited and so
uncertain that the prospects for the future are not very bright. The
protestant and government schools are getting control of most of the
Indians. The work of propagating the faith would require money, and
missionaries to consecrate themselves to the work— I have very little
money, and very little time to give to the Indian work. I have besides,
no missionaries to spare. The few attempts that I have made to induce
Religious to come to Arizona to work for the Indians, have failed.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Brownsville.</span></h3>

<p>Bishop Verdaguer makes this touching appeal. “For two years we
have not raised any crops and for the past six months we have experienced
the most severe drought ever known here. Two-thirds of our
priests cannot support themselves. Oh! please do for us what you can.
Remember, that along the Rio Grande there are 20,000 Mexican Indians
actually starving— living on dying cattle and boiled prickly pear leaves.
Most all the horses and cattle have disappeared. There is no grass,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
and has been no crop for two years. If you do not help us I know not
what we can do. Remember, that out of hundreds of half-breeds that
attend schools not one child pays anything. Remember, that many of
our priests have not received $100 during the past year. Please help
us. We need five chapels. These five could be built for $2000. Twelve
priests have to be helped on account of the drought and the misery to
be met with on every side. $150 for each of these would amount to
$1800. The Sisters ought to receive something for the half-breed children
taught gratuitously by them. An allowance of $4.00 for the yearly
tuition and books for each of these children would call for about $1500.
The Bishop himself has no resources, still he must visit his vicariate.
There is no house for him except a little shanty with two poor rooms.
Five chapels are badly needed. The people for whom they are designed
are exceedingly poor and are totally unable to contribute towards their
erection. If each one of these chapels were 50 by 30 feet we could have
them erected at a cost of $400 apiece. $2000 would suffice to build them.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Duluth, Minn.</span></h3>

<p>In this diocese there are 4,000 Catholic Indians, three churches and one
school for the Indians, and four priests attending the missions. These
four priests represent the Jesuit, Benedictine and Franciscan orders.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fort Wayne.</span></h3>

<p>There is a large Indian Normal School, situated in Rensselaer, in the
diocese of Fort Wayne. The school is under the direction of the Congregation
of the Holy Ghost and has an attendance of 81 young men. Four
of these are being educated for the priesthood. “If you could pay the
tuition of the four students,” writes Rev. A. Geitl, the President of the
school, “namely, $40 a year for each, we would esteem it a great favor.
We will supply everything else in the way of books, board and clothing.
I have tried everywhere to get a little help for these four young men.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Grand Rapids, Mich.</span></h3>

<p>There are 2500 Catholic Indians in the State of Michigan. Two
Regular priests, who attend seven churches, look after their spiritual
needs. The Catholic Indian Schools, three in number, have 243 pupils
enrolled. “We need $2000,” writes Bishop Richter “to pay teachers’ salaries
at Elbridge, Cross Village and Eagletown, to contribute towards the
support of the missionaries, and also to assist in the building of a church
at Harbor Springs.” The Indians of this diocese dwell in nine villages
the most prominent of which is Harbor Springs. This latter place
needs a new church. The church erected by the late Father Piery in
1842 is in a bad condition and is fast going to ruin. It is, moreover, too
small, being hardly large enough to hold the children of the parish.
The Indians as well as the white Catholics of the vicinity are poor, and
help from outside sources is urgently demanded. There is a large
Indian Boarding School in this village attended by 130 boarding pupils
and 30 day scholars. These pupils, come from all the villages save
Elbridge. This school, in the opinion of its director, the Rev. S. Altmicks,
needs to be enlarged, to accommodate children who at present are
unable to attend it through want of sufficient room. A tribe of Ottawa
Indians are within the limits of the diocese and have passed through
various vicissitudes of fortune. The Official Government Report on
Indian Affairs, for 1891, has this to say of them. “A great mistake was
made by the Government, when the allotment was made, in giving to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
the (above) Indians titles for their land without any restriction as to their
right to sell. As soon as the allotments were made, land sharks went
among the Indians and bought their lands for trivial sums, or loaned
them small sums of money at high rates of interest secured by mortgage,
on short time, and then foreclosed as soon as the law would permit them
to do so.” In 1888, through the zealous labors of Father Altmicks the
condition of affairs was brought before the Government, and a contract
was given for the support of the schools at Harbor Springs. “There is
very little hope for the prosperity of the Indians of the United States,
in this world,” writes Father Altmicks, “notwithstanding the good will of
some noble, honest and well meaning statesmen. But one thing I know,
in the next world there will be a number of our poor Indians— while of
our “civilized” people, hundreds of thousands will be cast out.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Green Bay, Wis.</span></h3>

<p>Out of 3500 Indians in this diocese 1300 are classed as Catholics.
They are all located on the Menominee Reservation. Two Franciscan
Fathers are exclusively engaged in missionary work among them.
There is a large Industrial School on the Reservation under the direction
of five Franciscan lay Brothers and eight Sisters of St. Joseph. “A
total amount of $7,500 is needed for carrying on the work of the mission,”
writes the Rev. J. A. Selbach. “As reported last year, our school
suffered a loss by fire amounting to nearly $20,000. The building has
been rebuilt, its re-erection and equipment running the missionaries into
heavy debt. Besides, a new church was sorely needed at Little Oconto
and has been built at great expense on the part of the Franciscan
Fathers, as yet it is not completed. A very necessary work is the
building of a new church at Kinepowa, calculated to be finished during
the coming summer, if the necessary means can be gotten for the same.
The two old buildings wherein divine service has been held so far, are
in ruinous condition, and so small that not more than half the respective
congregations can find room therein during divine service. They have
to attend outside, the doors being left open. It is needless to add how
hard and difficult this is for the poor people, to be thus exposed to the
inclemency of the weather especially during the long winter season. As
for the Oneida Reservation, there is a little frame church which has to
be brick-veneered. An addition ought to be built to this church and
also a school house constructed, at least, in course of time. The Government
does not help in the least; on the contrary, these (Oneidas)
Indians having been Protestants before, made all difficulties possible.
The Rector of Freedom Congregation, heretofore attending to the Oneida
Mission, is hardly able to do so any longer, as his congregation claims
all his time, and he is certainly unable to do full justice to the enterprise of
converting many more Oneidas. Wherefore it is absolutely necessary
that a priest be given to the Oneidas, having care of them alone. Such
a priest would, without the least doubt, convert many, for the Oneida
Indians are favorably impressed with the Catholic Religion.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Helena, Mont.</span></h3>

<p>There are twelve churches for Indians in this diocese, and sixteen
Indian Schools with 930 pupils enrolled. The Ursulines have a mother-house
located in the diocese as well as a novitiate. They devote themselves
entirely to the education of the Indians of the different missions.
“I will be called upon to pay for the debt of the Indian school and
novitiate and mother-house of the Ursulines” writes Bishop Brondel.
“These nuns were living for seven years in small log cabins and now they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
have a decent building considerably in debt. Two or three thousand
dollars would help considerably.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Idaho.</span></h3>

<p>Eleven hundred Catholic Indians are to be found in Idaho, four
churches and three boarding schools have been erected for them. “Our
Indian Missions continue to be prosperous” writes Bishop Glorieux.
“Last June I visited the Coeur d’Alénes, at De Smet, the Nez Percés, at
Lapnai and the Kootenais, near Bonner’s Ferry, in the northern part.
The magnificent reception they gave me as well as their piety, showed
that their faith is still lively. All the Coeur d’Alénes and the Kootenais
are practical Catholics. About one-fifth of the Nez Percés, viz., 300 are
Catholics, nearly all of whom are practical ones. Many of the Shoshones
and Bannocks in the south-eastern part of Idaho were baptized about
twenty-five years ago, but owing to the Government policy, the missionaries
could not visit them for a long time, and consequently, they have
given up their religion. The Lemhis in the eastern part have never
been visited, to my knowledge. They number nearly 500. Lack of
priests and funds is the principal cause of this neglect. I hope that in a
short time I will be able to do something for them.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Indian Territory.</span></h3>

<p>The Indian Territory is a great Indian centre, there being no less than
96,640 Indians within its borders. Of this great number but 3000 are
Catholics. These Catholic Indians have six churches which are regularly
attended by six Benedictine Fathers, of the Sacred Heart, and one
secular priest. There are five Catholic Indian boarding schools in the
Territory with an enrolment of 262 pupils. “A school should be built
in the Gwokow nation” writes Bishop Meerschaert, “for that nation and
other small tribes around. A church there is an absolute necessity.
Another school should be built in the Creek nation. We will try a day
school in Muscogee where we can build and be able to have sisters.
The trouble is that day schools with our Indians are impossibilities.
We have to clothe the children, board them and teach them. When
our schools are built, if we could have all the children we could accommodate
it would be all right, but the Morgan system is there to destroy
all. He has been a perfect scourge for our Indians— refusing contracts,
diminishing them, building other Government schools at the expense of
the Indians, where Catholic schools already existed, and this in order to
destroy and ruin them. The Priest of Muscogee Creek Nation attempts
to visit nineteen places. He writes that two priests more are needed
there and they must be supported, as no help comes from the Indians.
I will try to get priests to work for that mission and for many others
among the whites in the Oklahoma Territory. These I will have to
procure in Europe, as I cannot find them here. Hence, more expense.
This country is being populated rapidly. Everywhere new settlements
are springing up and towns and cities are developing. These towns and
cities are anxious to have churches and schools. As yet there is little
money and most is expected from the priest. Protestant associations
are building handsome churches everywhere and keeping our work back
where we cannot build. Notwithstanding our poverty several new
churches have been built this year, thanks to the great efforts and self-sacrifice
of the priests on the Missions. Their mass intentions and every
cent they can get go to the good work. They live very poorly in order
to be able to do the work. They are indeed hard workers and good,
pious and zealous priests. The Propagation allowance is $2,897.72.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
About $3000 below the sum given to me in former years. As the funds
of last year were exhausted before my arrival, except $450, I had to use
most of the present years’ allowance for the improvements and work of
the vicariate. As regards the Indian work; I have opened a new mission
among the Creeks, the Guokows and other surrounding tribes. I
have to build a church and school for the Guokows, and must help the
Creek nation to do the same. I hope the Commission will help us in
our poverty, for the money will be well spent in this large territory, the
home of nearly 100,000 Indians, and will do a great deal of good. I
beg God that I may find self-sacrificing priests and means to do our
work. Much good might be done here in a short time if priests and
sufficient means could be had. All the priests in charge of the missions
work most faithfully and cheerfully, notwithstanding all manner of
hardships. I enclose a check for $52.90, the full amount of the collection
taken up for Negroes and Indians. The amount is small, but it is the first
collection ever taken up for that purpose, I think. And as it is an expression
of the good will of our poor people, may our dear Lord accept
their good will and give them an abundance out of which to contribute
in the years to come. We cannot expect all the means actually needed
here in a new country like this, where everything is wanting and
resources few— yet with a little, much can be done.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">La Crosse, Wis.</span></h3>

<p>There are 1800 Catholic Indians in this diocese out of an Indian population
of 3500. These Catholic Indians have nine churches visited
regularly by three priests of the Order of St. Francis. Four large
schools, attended by 316 Indian children are in good running order,
under the direction of Franciscan Sisters. These schools were materially
assisted by last years allocation.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Marquette.</span></h3>

<p>About 2700 Catholic Indians dwell in this diocese, over half of the
resident Indian population. They have five churches and one school.
The churches are visited by two Jesuit Fathers and the school is conducted
by the Sisters of St. Joseph. The Missions and the priests
attending them were helped by the Negro and Indian Commission at
the last yearly distribution.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Natchez, Miss.</span></h3>

<p>Bishop Heslin, of Natchez, has four hundred Catholic Indians in his
diocese. They have one church and one school. “The number of
Catholic Indians in Neshoba Co., has now increased to 335, a considerable
gain over last year. Rev. B. J. Bekkers, with money lately collected
from friends in Holland, has made a further purchase of some 600 acres
to be portioned out among the Indians according to necessity. He
reports the Indians are very much distressed in consequence of the low
prices obtained for their crops, which were chiefly cotton. He cannot tell
how they will be able to tide over the time lapsing before the new crops.
The poor people have no credit, and they are now left dependent on
Divine Providence. I must confess that I am comparatively ignorant
of the other Indian Colony situated back of the coast; but I expect
before long to get better acquainted with them, and to be able to give a
more accurate account of them. A great deal has been said about the
efforts made, and the aid given by the Indian Bureau and by Mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Catherine Drexel, in behalf of the Indians, but we have as yet seen
nothing of them in Mississippi.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Nesqually.</span></h3>

<p>This diocese has quite a large Indian population, there being no less
than 18,000 within its limits. About 6,000 of these are Catholics.
Seven Jesuit Fathers are here engaged in Indian missionary work while
three diocesan priests visit the missions when opportunity affords.
There are seventeen churches exclusively for the Indians, while four
schools conducted by the Sisters of Providence look to the instruction
of the Indian children. “We could have a great many more children at
school,” writes Bishop Junger. “About three weeks ago eighteen children
were brought to Yakima to go to school, but they were not received as there
is no room there, and besides the Sisters of Providence have a great
number above their contract. The same may be said in regard to the
school at Blanket and Puyallup. Then there are several tribes which
would willingly accept the teachings of the Church, but missionaries
and priests are wanting. In my last report I mentioned that the diocese
of Nesqually does not receive an allocation in proportion to other
dioceses, concerning schools, missionaries and churches. I would not
reiterate this remark, and it is against my feelings that I do it again;
but I think my conscience obliges me to do so. Neither do I begrudge
the other dioceses what they receive. In the pamphlet, ‘Mission Work
among the Negroes and Indians,’ which was sent me a short time ago,
I see on page 21, under the heading ‘Indian Mission Work,’ that
Nesqually is not fairly represented in regard to priests and pupils, and
especially in regard to the latter. There are only 150 pupils mentioned,
whilst if you count them up in my report you will find nearly 400, and
this year there are about 450.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Oregon City.</span></h3>

<p>Two thousand, five hundred Indians dwell in this diocese. Eighteen
hundred of them are Catholics. Two priests attend the two churches
erected for the Catholic Indians. The two Indian schools, one of which
is taught by the Benedictine Sisters, report an enrollment of 191 pupils.
“Besides the current expenses,” writes Archbishop Gross, “I should like
about two or three hundred dollars to erect a modest chapel on the site
selected by me recently at the Silety reservation. I should also like
some additional donations for the Franciscan Sisters for their school at
the Umatilla reservation. In giving my report, I must state that the
Klamath Indians are large in numbers, and many of them are Catholics.
The reservation is in the hands of Methodists. I made an ineffectual
attempt to visit them some time ago. The next dry season I shall go
again and preach there, whether the government agent likes it or not.
I shall the next time not allow myself to be kept off the reservation.
There is a government school for the Indians near Salem, but so far
completely in the hands of the Protestants. I paid a most interesting
visit to the Silety. These poor Indians had been handed over to the
Methodists by General Grant, and the Catholic priests were ordered to
remain away from the Silety reservation. I went there uninvited this
summer and spent quite a time among them. I was astonished to
see how many had preserved the faith. Nearly all of them came to
confession. I administered Confirmation to a large number. I am not
quite sure as to the number of Indians in this diocese. For fear of
exaggerating, I have placed in my report a total, which I believe to be
in reality less than the true number.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">St. Cloud.</span></h3>

<p>We present an interesting letter from the Mother Superior of the
Sacred Heart Industrial School, at Morris, Minn. “I would have replied
long since in answer to your kind letter, but I met with a very severe
accident, a dislocation of my right shoulder, and I am not well yet. I
can use only my thumb and first finger. God grant that I may get the
use of the others, for it is a great loss to the poor children that I cannot
work. I am anxiously looking forward to September, and I trust what
our good Bishop Zardetti asked for us will be granted. Having lost
all our crops by hail and having had to build an addition to our building
by order of the Government, or lose our children; we are greatly in
need. We had to mortgage cattle, sheep and horses. Had I not
promised to pay in September we would have lost all. What we get
from the Government, $9 per month for the support, clothing, teaching
and travelling expenses of each pupil, falls far short of the actual
expense. For this reason we try to raise all we can. If we secure what
we expect all our difficulties will be over in regard to the Industrial
School, as it will be self-supporting. We are teaching the girls all kinds
of work. They make their own clothes as well as those of the boys.
They knit, spin and weave. We are now teaching them to do store
work; so that if any remain with us off the reservation they will be able
to support themselves. We are aiming at the plan of the Industrial
School at our convent in Brooklyn, which I organized some years ago.
If we can induce the parents of the children to let the latter remain with
us when their schooling is finished, it will be, in our opinion, the best
method of civilizing them. Oh, if we could but have help, how much good
we could do for the glory of God and the salvation of these dear souls!...
We are praying God to help us now in our struggles and if the
Commission will grant what is asked this year, we will not apply again.
We are insuring our crops this year for fear of hail and storms.”</p>

<p>Bishop Zardetti, of St. Cloud, endorses the foregoing letter in these
words, “I remit to you the enclosed petition, endorsing it from my
heart. The Sisters in Morris who are very poor, do much for the Indians
in their care, and are, I think, entitled to a subsidy from the Negro and
Indian Commission.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Santa Fé.</span></h3>

<p>Archbishop Salpointe has 8,000 Catholic Indians in his diocese. The
total Indian population aggregates 25,000. There are 18 churches and
11 schools in the diocese exclusively for Indians. These schools have
an enrollment of 433 pupils. Three priests devote nearly their whole
time to Indian missionary work. “We intend to carry out our school
work on a better plan,” writes the Most Rev. Archbishop. “The agents
of Commissioner Morgan are doing all in their power to ruin our schools
and to pervert our poor Catholic Indians, by means fair and foul. Their
efforts are especially directed against the faith and Catholic allegiance
of the Pueblos. If we could maintain our schools and especially if we
had the necessary means to maintain two more missionaries to attend
the Pueblos of Santa Jamingo, Saguna, Acoma and Zuni, we could
arrive at splendid results, because those Indians are better affected now
towards the Church, than they have been in years past. Moreover the
several thousand Navajoes (the tribe numbers over 20,000, most of whom
reside in this archdiocese,) are in sad need of missionaries, since the
Gospel has never been preached to them. They need schools, as we
have absolutely none for them. They are intelligent, and doubtless,
many of them would be won over easily to Catholicity.” Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
Chapelle of the same diocese writes “I trust that the amount asked for
in the names of the Most Rev. Archbishop and my own, will be allowed
us. Our Indians are very poor indeed and the resources of the archdiocese,
I may say, are <i>nil</i>, for the work of evangelizing these poor people.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">San Francisco, Cal.</span></h3>

<p>This diocese contains 1500 Indians, 800 of whom are Catholics.
There are two Churches and four schools for these Catholic Indians.
Both schools and churches are in charge of the Franciscans.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sioux Falls, S. D.</span></h3>

<p>There is a large Indian population in the two Dakotas. In the diocese
of Sioux Falls there are over 25,000. Of these, 5,400 are members of
the church. Ten churches are open to them. These are under the
charge of seven Benedictine and six Jesuit Fathers. The schools, twelve
in number, with an enrollment of 938 pupils, are directed by the above
mentioned fathers. “The year has been a most prosperous one,” writes
Bishop Marty, “both in conversions and in the formation of new Catholic
centres among the Sioux. Especially at the Standing Rock, Cheyenne
and Rosebud Agencies. A beautiful new church and parochial residence
has been built at Cheyenne Agency, and was dedicated, July 3rd,
on the occasion of the Catholic Congress. On the 19th the church was
blown down and the house partly destroyed by a cyclone. Only 50 per
cent. of the lumber can be used again for building. Five petitions were
presented for new churches on the different reservations. Each of these
churches would cost one thousand dollars, as building material, as well
as labor, is dear at a distance of fifty miles from railroad or river. There
is no building material on the prairie. I also have to maintain the missionaries
at Grand River and Cheyenne.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Vancouver Island, Alaska Missions.</span></h3>

<p>There are about 35,000 Indians on Vancouver Island and in Alaska.
Only 4000 of these are Catholics. These Indians have thirteen churches
and seven schools open to them. Some idea may be had of the extent
of the territory within which the Indian Missions are comprised, when
we reflect on the vast area, (593,000 square miles) which is included
within its limits. Fourteen zealous priests are here engaged in missionary
work. According to Bishop Lemmens the prospects for the future are
bright. “We have good hopes that all the Indians on the West Coast
will ultimately be Catholics; the majority are so now. The Missions on
the Yukon River and in the south-west of Alaska are very successful.
In all this diocese there are only four churches, in which it is possible to
take up a regular Sunday collection. The Cathedral is the only church
which brings in any pew rent. All the churches, except four, have to be
entirely supported from the general funds of the diocese.”</p>

<p>With the Alaska missions of the diocese of Vancouver Island we
bring our report to a close. The foregoing reports from the Bishops
of the South and Northwest speak louder than comment on them. The
Negroes and Indians stand in need of priests, of churches and of
schools. Much good could be done among them if the men and the
means were available. A rich field is here open to zealous missionaries,
and to the charitably disposed. Let all praise be meted out to the
noble few, both priests and sisters, who have consented to consecrate
their lives to this laudable work. May heaven continue to bless their
labors and to furnish them the meagre pittance of which they stand
so sorely in need.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
